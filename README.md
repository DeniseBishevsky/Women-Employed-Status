Intro:<br>
This project is the final project in the "Data Analysis" course at the Faculty of Engineering,
as a part of the BS.c degree 'Sciences for High-Tech' in Tel Aviv University.
In this project I chose to study a data set on the subject of Employed Status and analyze it using visualizations, hypothesis tests and finally build a regression model that predicts the employee's salary by age, sex and year.
